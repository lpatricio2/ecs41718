        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>My interests are all in general cuz right now im not sure on what im 
        really interested in, so basicly all i want to find out more about computer
        science, or something to do with technology it can be modern technology 
        or ancient ones sice we can only eveolve from our past so we wont make the 
        same mistake twice</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I am also interested in math, to be able to things faster and more 
        efficiently and to one day maybe be and inventor that will help yall with
        you're  everyday life, as well as to be able to solve complex problems in
        a more logical more common sense kida way, as well as using creativity and
        outside thinking</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Science is everywhere and we will be better of if we know what we are
        dealing with, to make dicoveries that will save other people, like a cure 
        for a terminal or lethal disease. to be able to explore beyond were we haven't
        yet reached, but it will all be as soon as we can conprehend it, there we
        will see it.</p>
